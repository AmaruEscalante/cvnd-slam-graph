# Graph SLAM - Computer Vision Nanodegree project 3

This repo contains the Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) method for a 2D square World.
The code generates a world, landmarks and series of random movements for a simulated robot in this world. After that, a list with the movements and measurements of the landmarks are returned and used for the computation of the matrices Omega and Chi.

Notebook 1. Contains the simulated sensor measurement from the landmarks.
Notebook 3. Computation of Graph SLAM
